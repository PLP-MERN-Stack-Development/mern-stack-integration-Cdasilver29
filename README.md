A full-stack blog platform built with **MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js**.  
It allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, organize them by category, and interact through comments.  

The app includes search, filtering, and pagination for smooth navigation, with both frontend and backend validation to ensure data integrity.  
It’s designed to demonstrate complete MERN integration, clean architecture, and modern state management in React.
